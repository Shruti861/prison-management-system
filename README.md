With the upsurge in crime rates, it has become very tedious for the Officers at the jail to
manage the criminals. At times, the criminal records prove to be useful even after a prisoner is
released after serving his/her sentence in prison.
The traditional methodology of maintaining criminal records in registers or written
papers proves to be ineffective and cumbersome as crime rates have increased a lot in
the past years. The written records can get lost or can be easily tampered with. 
This integrated information management system for prisoners provides a single system which keeps track of the prisoner records. It also
defines the roles and responsibilities of the people in charge of managing the prison - jailors and officers.
